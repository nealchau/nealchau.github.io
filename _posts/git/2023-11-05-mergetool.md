You don't understand 4 panel vim merge - and git merge itself is complex - someone else's changes, and git in a strange state. (None of which the boss is interested in.) 

Luckily you can delay gratification: for example, you profit by learning basic vim editing commands, so you actually have the most powerful tool at your fingertips.  Don't take the cookie, invest about 5 more minutes - yes it looks complicated at first, but hold on, it's actually simple and fast, and you'll get 2 more cookies.

The bash commands you need:

git config merge.tool vimdiff
git config merge.conflictstyle diff3
git config mergetool.prompt false
git mergetool
