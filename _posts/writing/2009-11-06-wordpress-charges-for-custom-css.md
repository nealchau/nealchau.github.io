title: wordpress charges for custom css
categories:

---

so i discovered this when i posted some python code to my other blog, and it came out too small. i found a blog with nicer code on it, and figured it must be the css, which i viewed and found what to do, it was to add

```

code, pre {
	font-size       : 11px;
	color             : #682;
}
```

to the stylesheet. so i went to appearance on my wordpress and tried to change it... but no... it says i can preview (and the preview looks nice) but i can't save this css. so i'm putting it here in case one day i have a way to have css.

[btw this is a very nice summary of html](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/qr.html)
