i hate beeps of all kinds. the new install was beeping when gdm started, then it was beeping for no reason when i hit capslock in the empty space, when man pages over the beginning or end of a manpage, etc. i needed this fixed. found a few things on the internet, but i feel my solution so far is incomplete:

add to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist blacklist pcspkr

add to .xinitrc xset b off xset b 0 0 0

add to .inputrc (this i knew already) set bell-style visible

add to .bashrc set visualbell export PAGER=less export LESS="-Q"

add to .vimperatorrc set visualbell
