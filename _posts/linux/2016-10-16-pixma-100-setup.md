this is a cheap and apparently old printer. Â Important points:

- It doesn't connect to my WiFi -- it needs a WPS button on the router
- It doesn't work with USB3 ports, needs to be connected to an older port
- It needs to be rebooted prior it each printing session
- The paper tray needs to be unfolded from the back, and the paper catcher needs to be unfolded from the front.
