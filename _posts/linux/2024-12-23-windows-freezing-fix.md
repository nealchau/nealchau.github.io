I've been typing on a nice laptop for about a year and a half, then 
lately it's been freezing, making it very annoying.  I've been watching 
Task Manager, then clicking on the lower left to Resource Monitor,
then lately escalated to the [Sysinternals Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)

But lately I just went through the power plans, and found that
probably an update set several settings away from maximum performance 
even when plugged in, so reverted those and freezing seems to have stopped!
